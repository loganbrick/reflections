What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the structure that it needs in order to receive commits. To initialize a structure, one only has to run the command 'git init'.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the collection of files to be committed. It offers the user the ability to pick and choose which files to commit. This way, the user can determine which files still need further refining before they can be added to the commit.
